# OCaml-Lite

During the spring of 2023, I worked on creating a dynamic version of the OCaml programming language with a subset of its features. The objective of this project was to acquire a comprehensive understanding of language processing, specifically focusing on learning the functionalities of a lexer, parser, and interpreter. The lexer breaks down a language into a set of tokens, the parser checks for the grammar of the language, and the interpreter gives significance to the language by assigning meaning. Through this project, I sought to gain skills in language implementation and insights into how programming languages such as OCaml operate.

Technologies Used:
Programming Langauges: OCaml

Tools: Visual Studio Code, Utop
